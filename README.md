# War3Source Evoultion

Updated for Sourcemod 1.8

If something is missing during compiling, let me know.


Currently not commpatible with the Original War3Source Races. May add compatibility later.

Translations do not fully work on this version, as I ripped out a lot of translations during updates for my private version.  English is the language used without translation files.


# Notes

* Compiles fine for TF2, but you may need certain extensions to run
* You need to go to change the contents in the file War3Source-EVO/addons/sourcemod/scripting/include/GAME_SWITCHER/currentgame.inc in order to compile for your platform
