Warcraft MOTD:
War3Evo | Warcraft Trade | Level Up Abilities | 24/7 Hyrule

This is a Warcraft 3 server, meaning you can pick races with abilities attached to them and level them up. It is also a trade server, specifically for the buying and selling of Team Fortress 2 items!

RULES:
1. No random trading! Please be sure to ask people if they would like to trade with you before sending a trade request!
2. No mic spam! While most trade servers allow it, we'd like our comms to be clear for conversations about trade, as well as casual conversation.
3. Don't be a dick! No excessive insulting, especially towards admins.
4. No scamming! Price check everything before trading, and if someone gives you less than you ask for, make sure you ask them if they're sure. If you think you've been scammed, tell an admin!
